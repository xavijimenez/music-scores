# Music Scores & Compositions 🎼

Welcome to the personal archive of **Xavier Jiménez-Albán**. This repository serves as a digital library where I maintain high-quality engravings of classical masterpieces as well as my **original compositions**.

## 🚀 About this Project

All scores in this repository are engraved using **GNU LilyPond**, following a "music as code" philosophy to ensure precision, version control, and high-quality typographical output.

You will find content for various instruments, including:
* **Classical & Electric Guitar** (Fingerstyle, Classical, Contemporary)
* **Piano**
* And other solo instruments.

## 📂 Directory Structure

The repository is organized taxonomically to facilitate navigation:
